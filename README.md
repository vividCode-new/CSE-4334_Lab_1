For Part A:
  To run the program, simply compile and run. The program generates 50,000 random numbers and organizes them in an array twice. The first time it shall be through the unoptimized algorithm, which for us is bubble sort.
  Once that is completed, the program will do it again with the optimized algorithm, which is quick sort for us. Afterwards, it shall list the processing and total time for both algorithms. 
  We then calculate the proportion of optimizable code, the speedup of the optimized code, the overall measured speedup, and then the theortical speedup. 

For Part B:
